# rosalind-problems
My solutions for ROSALIND (rosalind.info) bioinformatics problems (rosalind.info)

datasets from rosalind.info to test solutions are located in submission_data_files/ where prefix number corresponds to problem number.

solutions are contained in rosalind-#.py files where # corresponds to problem number. 

helper files (such as dictionary with codon/amino acid mapping in "rna-codon-dict.pickle" are found in directory helper_files

run as: ./rosalind-#.py [path] where path is the path to the corresponding dataset file
